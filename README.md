# everything-calculator
A collection of tools/calculators.

The project is a simple Flask site currently hosted [here](https://everything-calculator.vercel.app/)


## List of Calculators:
Here’s a breakdown of the calculators currently included (Sorted by most recently added on top):

- Area/Perimeter | Circle and Regular Polygons

## Contributing:
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Check out the existing calculators or suggest new ones.
3. Submit a pull request with your improvements.

### Contribution Guidelines:
- Make sure you aren't creating a duplicate calculator.
- Use either camelCase or snake_case.
- Clearly document your changes in comments and commit messages.

### Version Naming Convention:
The project uses a three-digit versioning format: `0.XYZ`

- **X (ones place)** – Major structural changes, like large file reorganizations/logic updates.
- 
- **Y (tenths place)** – New calculator/page additions.
- 
- **Z (hundredths place)** – Minor changes, such as grammar fixes or small bug fixes in calculators.  

Once a digit exceeds 9, it rolls over to the next place (ex: `0.249` -> `0.250`).

## Support:
